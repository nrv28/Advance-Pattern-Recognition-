# Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates breast cancer classification using logistic regression on the scikit-learn breast cancer dataset. It includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and visualization of feature importance and ROC curve.

## Files

- [`BreastCancerDetection.ipynb`](c:/Users/astit/Downloads/APR%20Assignment/BreastCancerDetection.ipynb): Main Jupyter notebook containing all code and analysis.
- `Breast_Cancer_Logistic_Regression_Report.docx`: Report summarizing the project and results.

## Features

- Loads and explores the breast cancer dataset.
- Visualizes class distribution and feature importance.
- Splits data into training and test sets.
- Standardizes features.
- Trains a logistic regression model.
- Evaluates model accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Plots ROC curve and calculates AUC.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install dependencies with:

```sh
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Open [`BreastCancerDetection.ipynb`](c:/Users/astit/Downloads/APR%20Assignment/BreastCancerDetection.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to execute the workflow and view results.

## Results

- Achieves high accuracy in classifying malignant and benign tumors.
- Provides visualizations for class distribution, feature importance, and ROC curve.
